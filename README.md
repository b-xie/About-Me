# About-Me

Fields: Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Robotics, Autonomous Driving
Topics: 3D Computer Vision, Sensor Fusion, AotoML, Model compression, Unsupervised/Semi-supervised Learningï¼Œalgorithm simulation

I have a strong professional background in machine/deep learning algorithm design and vehicle inspection and maintenance. I learned sensor detection, C++, and MLP and SVM when I was a bachelor. After that, I specifically learned machine learning and deep learning, and focused on computer vision. In addition, I systematically studied automobile structure and principles during my bachelor's degree, and then engaged in automobile inspection and maintenance at my work place. I have rich hands-on skills and often practice internships in automobile maintenance companies and driverless companies. More see https://www.linkedin.com/in/bangquanxie/
